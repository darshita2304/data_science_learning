Upload the attached csv in a Pandas Dataframe.

1. Create a new column col5. The value in col5 should be the maximum value of col1, col2, col3 and col4 for the particular row.
2. Calculate the standard deviation for each column, col1 to col5. Store the standard deviation for each column in a dictionary. 
eg. output should be {"col1": 32.2, "col2": 23.3, ...}
3. Find out all the index numbers(row numbers) if the value in any column of the row is more than 1.5 times of the average value of the corresponding column.
